# Installation & Customization

## Setup Instructions

1. **Configure the application**
   - Edit `main.py` to adjust program arguments
   - (Optional) Replace the included API key with your own

2. **Review installation settings**
   - Edit `setup.sh` and review the commands at the top
   - Update the `app_directory` variable to match your desired installation location
   
   **Note:** By default, `setup.sh` will:
   - Install required Python packages
   - Create a virtual environment for the program
   - Install a systemd service to auto-start the program on boot
   
   If you don't want the auto-start service, remove the relevant service installation commands from the script.

3. **Run the installer**
```bash
   ./setup.sh
```
   
   Once complete, the service will be running on port 1991.
